# Platformer
Let's build a more thought through game using [Brackeys' Platformer Bundle](https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle)

Think I'm going to call this finished. You can move around, the collision detection is pretty janky, but more or less works. We have basic sprite-based animations and really simple sounds playing.
